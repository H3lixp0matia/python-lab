The name 1. FC Union Berl was used by two football s that shared a common orig as FC Olympia 06 Obersch neweide, founded  1906  the Obersch neweide district of Berl. The side ok on the name SC Union 06 Obersch neweide  1910. Union was one of Berl's premier s  the terwar period, regularly wng local championships and competg at the national level, cludg an appearance  the 1923 German championship fal which they lost 0 3  Hamburger SV.
Early on the team was nicknamed "Schlosserjungs" (English: metalworker-boys), because of their then all blue kit, remiscent of the typical work clothg worn  the facries of the dustrial Obersch neweide district. The popular cry of Union-supporters   "Eisern Union!" (Iron Union)   also emerged at this time. Sce its foundation the  had a clearly workg-class image  contrast  other local s with middle-class origs, such as Vikria 89 Berl, Blau-Wei  90 Berl, BSV 92 Berl or Tennis Borussia Berl.
In 1933, German football was reorganized under the Third Reich  16 p flight divisions known as Gauligen. Obersch neweide became part of the Gauliga Berl-Brandenburg where they generally earned middlg results. They were relegated  1935 and returned  first division play  1936 after only one season's absence. In 1940, the team fished first  Group B of the division and then defeated Blau-Weiss (1 2, 3 0)  w the overall division title. That advanced the   the national playoffs where they were put out by Rapid Wien  the openg group round (2 3, 1 3). Union resumed its place as an unremarkable side. They were relegated aga  1942 and played the fal war-shortened Gauliga season  1944 45.




After World War II, occupyg Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of all organizations  Germany, cludg sports and football associations. A new Municipal Sports Group called SG Obersch neweide was formed  late 1945 and it played  the City League organized immediately after the war which had four regional departments. The team did not qualify  the newly created Oberliga Berl (I)  1946 after a poor season, but was promoted  1947, won the division title right away and regaed  status as SG Union 06 Obersch neweide durg 1948 49.
The  fished the 1949 50 season  second place  Berl and qualified  take part  the national fal rounds. However, escalatg Cold War tensions led Soviet authorities  refuse the team permission  travel  take part. Two Union teams then emerged as most players and coaches fled  the west  form Sport-Club Union 06 Berl which ok part  the scheduled playoff match  Kiel agast Hamburger SV, losg 0:7.
The players remag  the east carried on as Union Obersch neweide while a number of players who had fled  the west  form SC organized a third side called Berler Ballspiel-Club S dost. The western team was a strong side until the construction of the Berl Wall  1961, drawg huge crowds  matches  the Olympiastadion. The division of the city led  a change of fortunes for the  which plays day  the lower divisions before meager crowds.




The eastern branch of the  went through a number of name changes: Union Obersch neweide (1950), BSG Mor Obersch neweide (1951), SC Mor Berl (1955), TSC Obersch neweide (1957), TSC Berl (1963)   fally becomg the football  1. FC Union Berl  1966. They developed a bitter rivalry with Stasi-sponsored Dynamo Berl. While their arch rivals won 10 titles  a row  highly dubious circumstances, Union yo-yoed between the Oberliga and the DDR-Liga with very little success, largely due  the East German's government policy of favourg 'elite' s at the expense of 'civilian' s like Union. Union managed  w the East German Cup  1968 when they defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 2:1 although they lost  their second cup appearance  1986  1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig by a score of 1:5.




After German reunification  1990, the team contued  perform well on the field, but almost collapsed fancially. They managed  hang on through some tight times and fd sponsorship, but only after wng their division  both 1993 and 1994 and each time beg denied a license  play  the 2. Bundesliga due  their fancial problems. The  had another close brush with fancial failure  1997.
Union aga came close  advancg  2.Bundesliga  1998 99 and 1999 2000, but were disappoted. They were fally successful  2000 01, under Bulgarian manager Georgi Vasilev, easily wng the Regionalliga Nord (III) and movg up a division  become the city's most popular side after the Bundesliga's Hertha BSC. That same year they appeared  the fal of the German Cup where they lost 0 2  FC Schalke 04, and advanced as far as the second round  UEFA Cup before beg put out by Bulgarian side PFC Litex Lovech. The  slipped  the Regionalliga Nord (III)  2004 05 and then  the NOFV-Oberliga Nord (IV)  2005 06, but has returned  third division play after capturg the Oberliga title. In 2008 09, Union became one of the foundg s of the new 3rd Liga, and its augural champion, securg first place and promotion  the 2. Fu ball-Bundesliga on 10 May.




In 1920 SC Union Obersch neweide (forerunner of day's 1. FC Union Berl) had  fd a new home ground as its former pitch had been built over by developers with residential buildgs. The  moved a little further away from the city  the north-western part of the borough of K penick. The new stadium was officially opened  August 1920 with a match between Obersch neweide and the then German champions 1. FC Nuremberg (1:2). The augural match  at the Alte F rsterei had already been played on 17 March, when Union challenged Vikria 89 Berl.

When Union won promotion  the DDR-Oberliga (the p flight  East Germany)  1966, the stadium soon needed  be expanded. The ground was first expanded  1970 when the Gegengerade terrace was raised, whilst further extensions  the terracg at both ends  the late 1970s and early 1980s creased the capacity furthermore  22,500. However, the somewhat spartan facilities at Alte F rsterei had quickly begun  show their age though, as the  was not able  properly mata the expansive ground as attendances -  common with the majority of s  the East and West - went  a serious decle. Later, after German reunification, when Union were assigned by the German Football Association  play  the 3rd league, the outdated stadium proved only one of a number of facrs that hampered the 's push for promotion  higher leagues.
In the summer of 2008, the  decided  fally modernise the stadium, the Stadion An der Alten F rsterei (Old Forester's House). Money was still tight, and so the fans simply built the ground themselves. More than 2,000 Union supporters vested 140,000 workg hours  create what is now regarded as the largest football-only stadium  Berl. The official openg on 12 July 2013, was celebrated with a friendly agast Scottish Champions Celtic F.C.. It holds 22,012 people with 3,617 seats. The rest is terracg.



In 2014 the  came up with the idea of vitg fans  take their own sofas  the ground for the whole of the World Cup. More than 800 sofas were placed on the pitch  rows  front of the big screen.
